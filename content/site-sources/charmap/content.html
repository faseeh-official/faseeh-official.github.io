<h1>A Simple Character Map</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/charmap-preview.jpg">
<p>I grew tired of the default Windows character map. While it offers many features that make finding characters easier, I felt it was lacking in some areas. I searched for a better alternative but struggled to find a simple option (perhaps this is just my experience) that allows me to group the characters which I frequently use. So, I decided to create one using Python and Tkinter.</p>

<p>While my version still lacks many features, it includes the one I wanted the most.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Simply click a character to copy it to your clipboard.</li>
    <li>Add frequently used characters to your favorites for quick access.</li>
    <li>The application contains only essential characters that aren't available on the standard keyboard. However, you can add more by pasting them into the 'Clipboard' entry field and clicking 'Add to Favorites'.</li>
</ul>

<p>Give it a try!</p>
