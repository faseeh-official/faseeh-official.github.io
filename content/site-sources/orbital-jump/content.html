    Orbital Jump is a simple yet challenging Unity game centered around the mechanics of gravity. You play as an astronaut, rocket, or any flying object, navigating planets and using your jetpack to reach the finishing platform from the starting point. The controls are straightforward: use the left mouse button for the left thruster and the right mouse button for the right thruster.

    However, mastering this game is far from easy. Unlike the everyday gravity we experience on Earth, the game simulates gravitational pull over vast distances. The farther you are from a planet, the weaker the gravitational force becomes, demanding precise control and strategy. Some levels require you to predict your entire trajectory before even launching from the platform, adding a layer of complexity. What might seem like a simple game is, in reality, a true test of skill, timing, and understanding of gravity. Are you ready to take on the challenge?
